headline: "Full-Stack Developer & Automation Specialist"

bio: |
  I'm Ze Lu Sottomayor, a full-stack developer based in Lisbon.

  I build AI-powered tools and automation systems for founders and small teams. Most of my work involves connecting existing tools, building custom workflows, and creating web applications that solve specific problems.

  I've worked on projects ranging from AI coaching apps to UX analysis tools, always focusing on practical solutions that work in production.

current_focus: |
  I'm currently doing freelance development while building my own products. My recent projects include UX Audit App (an AI-powered UX analysis tool) and AI Talk Coach (a speaking practice app using Claude).

  Most of my client work falls into two categories:

  1. **Automation projects** - connecting tools like Airtable, Notion, and various APIs to eliminate manual data work.
  2. **Product development** - building functional web apps with Rails, integrating AI APIs, and getting things to production quickly.

how_i_work:
  - "I build working prototypes first, then refine based on real usage"
  - "Every project has clear deliverables and milestones - no vague promises"
  - "I prefer tools and approaches I know work, rather than chasing trends"

expertise:
  - "Full-stack development (Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Python)"
  - "AI integration (Claude API, OpenAI, prompt engineering)"
  - "Automation tools (Make, Zapier, n8n, API integrations)"
  - "Product design and user experience"

credentials:
  - "Several years building web applications and automation systems"
  - "Developed products like UX Audit App, AI Talk Coach, and various client tools"
  - "Based in Lisbon, working with clients remotely"

personal_touch: |
  When I'm not coding, I'm usually exploring Lisbon or testing new AI tools to see what's actually useful versus what's just hype.

  I believe good software solves real problems without unnecessary complexity.
